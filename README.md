# pyumami
Umami substances can increase the overall taste of food and bring pleasure to people. However, the umami substances excavated in previous studies were limited, mainly because the crystalline structure of the umami receptor and the taste-sensing mechanism remain undetermined. This study presents an in silico approach based on QSAR models and molecular docking to explore novel umami molecules with bitter and sweet characteristics. We determined the toxicity of 169 potential umami molecules and found the concentration of 10 nontoxic molecules in food. We also verified 18 small umami molecules, which had more intense umami characteristics than sodium glutamate, such as celeston and trichlorogalactosucrose. These new umami molecules are expected to contribute to the study of the crystal structure of umami receptors and taste-sensing mechanisms in the aspect of molecular dynamics and to provide a theoretical basis for the practical application of new umami molecules in food.
